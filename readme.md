# Showdown Set to JSON Converter
## Created by Damon Murdoch (@SirScrubbington)
### Summary
This Python application was developed for the 
simplification of creating the .json files required
for Pokemon Showdown! Server randomised formats. This
application converts all of the (valid) files in the 
/in directory to .json files and saves them in the /out
directory by default. 
### Expected Format
The Expected Format for input sets is as follows:

Species @ Item 1 / Item 2 / ...
Ability: Ability 1 / Ability 2 / ...
EVs: n HP / n Atk / n SpD / ...
IVs: n Atk / n Spe / ....
Nature 1 / Nature 2 / ... nature
- Move 1 / Move 2 / ...
- Move 1 / Move 2 / ...
- Move 1 / Move 2 / ...
- Move 1 / Move 2 / ...

### Future Features
In future, I would like to make 
allowances for the following tags:
Shiny: True/False
Level: 1-100

Any other relevant tags which may be applied.
